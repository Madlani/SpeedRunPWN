I think that having the 'whip cracking' is useful for getting us back on track definitely, although it was kind of
stressful trying to play that catch up game after being lost for a while. This semester's just been extra tough,
and is genuinely the first semester that I've "fallen behind" in a class, but I guess that's just life and I'm
glad to kind of be slowly but surely catching up. It took me a while to figure out how to go about the 
exploits at first, since I was still unfamiliar with the overall concept of pwning, but I do think that having
a specific example that was worked through thoroughly maybe posted on the website would have been beneficial. There
was a few challenges went over in class, but I think that while I was lost, I didn't gain as much as I could have during
these explanations since it was a little too fast paced rather than an example on the website. I think that
there was a lot of material packed into these lectures, which is beneficial if you can pick up on stuff quickly,
but I think part of the reason for the 'black boxes' not asking as many questions is because we got lost on elementary
stuff and weren't comfortable with asking these questions (but in retrospect, asking these questions is the easiest
way to clear up this stuff - you rock when having 1:1 conversations with students). I think that for future semesters,
it would be useful to present certain concepts in class/post them on your website, and then provide a step by step
example for us to really understand/reference while doing the future work! I also know that you're not the biggest fan of
deadlines and assigning them to assignments, but I think that if they're done correctly/have a decent amount of work
that's due rather than a huge assignment like a project, it can be used as a really good checkpoint with students
to see how they're progressing.
